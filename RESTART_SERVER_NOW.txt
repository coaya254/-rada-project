🚨 IMPORTANT: YOU MUST RESTART YOUR SERVER! 🚨

The blog API code has been updated but the server is still running the OLD code.

HOW TO RESTART:

1. Find the terminal/command prompt where server.js is running
2. Press Ctrl+C to stop it
3. Run: node server.js
4. Wait for "Server running on port 5000"

THEN:
- Go to Admin Dashboard
- Go to Blog Posts section
- You should now see all 4 blog posts!

If you don't restart, the admin will show 0 posts because the server hasn't loaded the new code yet.

✅ AFTER RESTART, DELETE THIS FILE
