## 🚀 FASTEST PATH TO COMPLETION

Given context constraints, here's what I recommend:

**Option 1: Add Routes Now, Create Pages Later**
- Add all 4 new pages to App.jsx routes
- Create placeholder versions
- Users can access them immediately
- Polish later

**Option 2: Focus on Bills Only**
- Bills & Legislation is most important
- Create that fully now
- Other pages can be simple statics

**Option 3: All at Once in Next Session**
- Current pages are working
- Create all remaining in fresh session
- Less context switching

## 📝 RECOMMENDED ACTION

**I recommend**: Let me create one more critical piece - **Bills & Legislation** - since it's core to the app, then we can add routes and test.

The other 3 pages (Careers, Blog Author, Blog Section) are simpler and can be created in 5 minutes each in a follow-up.

**What would you like me to do?**
1. Create Bills & Legislation now (most important)
2. Create all 4 simple pages quickly
3. Just add routes and placeholders for now
4. Stop here and test what we have

I'm ready to continue with any option!
