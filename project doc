Rada.ke - Project Blueprint & Concept Document
Executive Overview
Rada.ke is Kenya's comprehensive civic-tech platform designed to engage, represent, and empower youth through storytelling, education, data analytics, and collective action. Built for digital-native generations, it bridges the gap between citizens and government by providing tools to track promises, voice public sentiment, learn civics, and document events that shape our society.
Problem Statement
Kenya's youth are highly active in civic life but remain underrepresented in public discourse, policy processes, and media coverage. Their civic actions, voices, and leadership are fragmented across social media, protest movements, and informal networks‚Äîrarely documented, recognized, or tied back to systemic change.
As misinformation spreads and institutional trust declines, youth lack the tools to meaningfully engage with governance, monitor accountability, and access civic education in relevant, mobile-first formats.

‚Ä¢ Storytelling ‚Äì Publish, archive, and highlight grassroots civic action ‚Ä¢ Civic Education ‚Äì Gamified learning modules, challenges, and explainers ‚Ä¢ Government Tracking ‚Äì Dashboards to monitor promises, budgets, and delivery ‚Ä¢ Sentiment & Voice ‚Äì Public mood polls and digital participation tools with direct government engagement ‚Ä¢ Access & Inclusion ‚Äì Offline PWA + USSD/SMS access, multilingual support
Target Users
‚Ä¢ Young Kenyans (14-30) seeking meaningful civic engagement ‚Ä¢ Grassroots organizers and movement leaders ‚Ä¢ Journalism students and citizen reporters ‚Ä¢ CSOs, civic educators, and advocacy groups ‚Ä¢ Youth who want to participate, learn, and be heard
