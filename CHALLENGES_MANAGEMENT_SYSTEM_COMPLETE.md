- ✅ Full CRUD admin interface
- ✅ Can create/edit/delete challenges
- ✅ Can add lessons and quizzes as tasks
- ✅ Active/inactive publishing system
- ✅ Enrollment protection
- ✅ User-facing screen still works (ChallengeDetailScreen)

## Summary

You now have a complete admin management system for Regular Challenges (multi-task learning campaigns) that is:
- **Separate** from Daily Challenges (quiz-based daily engagement)
- **Fully functional** with CRUD operations
- **Task-based** allowing lessons and quizzes to be combined
- **User-ready** with the existing ChallengeDetailScreen.tsx for users to view and complete

The system allows admins to create campaigns like "Democracy Week" with multiple lessons and quizzes, set difficulty levels, manage visibility, and track user enrollments.
