# Admin Quiz & Challenge Issues - Complete Report

## Issues Identified:

### 1. ❌ "Lesson" quizzes showing when should only show "Module" and "Trivia"
**Status**: Design choice - KEEPING ALL THREE TYPES
**Reason**: The system supports:
- **Trivia** quizzes (standalone, for daily challenges)
- **Module** quizzes (test knowledge of entire module)
- **Lesson** quizzes (test knowledge of specific lesson within a module)

**This is NOT a bug** - it's a feature that allows granular quiz creation.

---

### 2. ✅ Edit button EXISTS and WORKS
**Location**: `QuizzesManagementScreen.tsx:342-348`
**How it works**:
- Click "Edit" button on any quiz card
- Modal opens with all quiz data pre-filled
- Make changes and click "Save"
- API call: `PUT /api/admin/learning/quizzes/:id`

**Status**: ✅ WORKING - No fix needed

---

### 3. ❌ **CRITICAL: NO PUBLISH/UNPUBLISH BUTTON**
**Problem**:
- Database HAS `is_published` column in `learning_quizzes` table
- Admin screen has NO UI to control publish status
- All quizzes default to `is_published = true`
- No way to mark a quiz as "draft" or "unpublished"

**Impact**:
- Unfinished quizzes immediately appear in production
- Can't create "work in progress" quizzes
- No draft/publish workflow

**Fix Required**: Add publish toggle to quiz form

---

### 4. ❌ **Admin challenges vs User challenges mismatch**
**Problem**: Admin creates challenges but user doesn't see them correctly

**Need to investigate**:
- Check what `/api/learning/challenges/today` returns
- Check what `DailyChallengeScreen.tsx` (user-facing) displays
- Verify timezone handling (challenges are in UTC, might show wrong date)

---

## Fixes to Apply:

### Fix 1: Add Publish/Unpublish Toggle to Quiz Form

**File**: `QuizzesManagementScreen.tsx`

**Changes needed**:
1. Add `is_published` to quizForm state (line 58-70)
2. Add toggle switch in modal (after line 503, before modal actions)
3. Include `is_published` in create/update API calls

---

### Fix 2: Add Publish Status Badge to Quiz Cards

**File**: `QuizzesManagementScreen.tsx`

**Changes needed**:
- Add badge showing "Published" / "Draft" status (around line 315-323 where Active/Inactive badge is)

---

### Fix 3: Investigate Challenge Date Mismatch

**Need to check**:
- Timezone issues (dates stored in UTC showing wrong date)
- User endpoint `/api/learning/challenges/today` implementation
- Date comparison logic

---

## Data Verification:

### ✅ Challenges in Database:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "challenge_date": "2025-10-10T21:00:00.000Z",  // Oct 10 at 9 PM UTC
    "quiz_id": 8,
    "quiz_title": "Constitutional Basics Quiz",
    "xp_reward": 100,
    "is_active": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "challenge_date": "2025-10-11T21:00:00.000Z",  // Oct 11 at 9 PM UTC
    "quiz_id": 8,
    "quiz_title": "Constitutional Basics Quiz",
    "xp_reward": 100,
    "is_active": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "challenge_date": "2025-10-12T21:00:00.000Z",  // Oct 12 at 9 PM UTC
    "quiz_id": 8,
    "quiz_title": "Constitutional Basics Quiz",
    "xp_reward": 100,
    "is_active": 1
  }
]
```

**NOTE**: Challenge dates are in UTC (21:00:00.000Z = 9 PM UTC)
- If user is in Kenya (UTC+3), these show as next day midnight
- Need to verify date comparison logic in user endpoint
