# Daily Challenge System - Integration Complete

## Summary

The Daily Challenge system has been fully integrated, connecting the frontend React Native UI to the backend API with real database storage.

## What Was Completed

### ✅ 1. Database Setup
**File:** `create-daily-challenge-attempts-table.js`

Created the `user_daily_challenge_attempts` table with:
- User ID and Challenge ID (foreign keys)
- Score tracking (score, max_score, computed percentage)
- Time taken (in seconds)
- User answers (JSON format)
- Completed timestamp
- Proper indexes for performance
- Unique constraint to prevent duplicate attempts

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_daily_challenge_attempts (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  challenge_id INT NOT NULL,
  score INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  max_score INT NOT NULL,
  percentage INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (ROUND((score / max_score) * 100)) STORED,
  time_taken INT NOT NULL COMMENT 'Time in seconds',
  answers JSON COMMENT 'User answers array',
  completed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (challenge_id) REFERENCES learning_daily_challenges(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

  UNIQUE KEY unique_user_challenge (user_id, challenge_id),
  INDEX idx_challenge_score (challenge_id, score DESC),
  INDEX idx_user_completed (user_id, completed_at)
);
```

### ✅ 2. Backend API Fixes
**File:** `learning-advanced-features.js`

**Fixed 4 Critical Issues:**

1. **Line 177** - Check if user completed (table name fix)
2. **Line 229** - Check already completed (table name fix)
3. **Line 260** - Save attempt with proper fields (added max_score, answers, fixed field names)
4. **Line 341** - Leaderboard query (fixed table name, rank variable escaping)

**Endpoints Available:**
- ✅ `GET /api/learning/challenges/today` - Get today's challenge with questions
- ✅ `POST /api/learning/challenges/:id/attempt` - Submit challenge attempt
- ✅ `GET /api/learning/challenges/:id/leaderboard` - Get top performers
- ✅ `GET /api/learning/challenges/streak` - Get user streak info

**Features Implemented:**
- Auto-creates daily challenge if none exists for today
- Checks if user already completed challenge
- Calculates score from user answers
- Awards XP on completion
- Updates user streaks (67%+ accuracy required)
- Generates leaderboard with rankings
- Prevents duplicate attempts

### ✅ 3. Frontend Integration
**File:** `RadaAppClean/src/screens/learning/DailyChallengeScreen.tsx`

**Replaced Mock Data with Real API:**

**Changes Made:**
1. Added `LearningAPIService` import
2. Added API-related state variables:
   - `todayChallenge` (from API)
   - `leaderboard` (from API)
   - `challengeId` (tracking current challenge)
   - `loading` (loading state)
   - `alreadyCompleted` (if user already did today's challenge)
   - `answersArray` (tracking user selections)

3. **Fetch Challenge on Mount:**
   - Calls `getTodayChallenge()`
   - Maps API question format to component format
   - Checks if user already completed

4. **Fetch Streak on Mount:**
   - Calls `getStreak()`
   - Updates current and longest streak displays

5. **Track User Answers:**
   - Updated `handleAnswerSelect()` to store answers
   - Prepares data for submission

6. **Submit on Complete:**
   - Updated `handleChallengeComplete()` to call API
   - Submits answers and time taken
   - Updates streak from response
   - Fetches leaderboard after submission

7. **Display Leaderboard:**
   - New `fetchLeaderboard()` function
   - Formats API data for display
   - Shows top 10 performers

8. **Loading States:**
   - Added loading screen
   - Added "no challenge available" screen
   - Better error handling

### ✅ 4. API Service Updates
**File:** `RadaAppClean/src/services/LearningAPIService.ts`

**Added Missing Method:**
```typescript
async getStreak() {
  const response = await this.api.get('/learning/challenges/streak');
  return response.data;
}
```

### ✅ 5. Data Fixes
**File:** `check-quiz-questions.js`

**Problem Identified:** Daily challenge was pointing to Quiz 4 (which had no questions)

**Solution:** Updated to use Quiz 8 ("Constitutional Basics Quiz") with 5 questions

**Current Challenge Data:**
- Challenge ID: 1
- Quiz ID: 8 ("Constitutional Basics Quiz")
- Questions: 5
- XP Reward: 100

---

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:

1. **User Opens Daily Challenge Screen**
   - Frontend calls `GET /api/learning/challenges/today`
   - Backend returns today's challenge with 5 questions
   - Frontend calls `GET /api/learning/challenges/streak`
   - Displays current streak and longest streak

2. **User Starts Challenge**
   - Timer starts (2 minutes)
   - User selects answers for each question
   - Answers are tracked in component state

3. **User Completes Challenge**
   - Frontend calls `POST /api/learning/challenges/:id/attempt`
   - Sends: challenge ID, answers array, time taken
   - Backend:
     - Calculates score
     - Saves attempt to database
     - Awards XP
     - Updates streak (if 67%+ accuracy)
     - Returns: score, percentage, XP earned, new streak

4. **Results Displayed**
   - Shows final score and accuracy
   - Shows if streak was maintained
   - Frontend calls `GET /api/learning/challenges/:id/leaderboard`
   - Displays top 10 performers

## Database Integration

### Tables Used:
1. ✅ `learning_daily_challenges` - Stores daily challenges
2. ✅ `user_daily_challenge_attempts` - Stores user attempts
3. ✅ `learning_quizzes` - Quiz metadata
4. ✅ `learning_quiz_questions` - Quiz questions
5. ✅ `user_learning_streaks` - User streak tracking
6. ✅ `user_learning_progress` - XP and progress
7. ✅ `user_xp_transactions` - XP award history

### Data Flow:
```
Daily Challenge → Quiz → Questions
     ↓
User Attempt → Score Calculation → XP Award → Streak Update
     ↓
Leaderboard Rankings
```

## Known Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Table Name Mismatch
**Problem:** Backend referenced `user_challenge_attempts` but table was named `user_daily_challenge_attempts`
**Fix:** Updated all references to use correct table name

### Issue 2: Field Name Mismatch
**Problem:** Code used `time_completed_seconds` but table has `time_taken`
**Fix:** Changed all references to `time_taken`

### Issue 3: Missing Fields in INSERT
**Problem:** INSERT statement didn't include `max_score` and `answers`
**Fix:** Added both fields with proper values

### Issue 4: MySQL Reserved Word 'rank'
**Problem:** SQL syntax error with `rank` column alias
**Fix:** Used `@user_rank` variable and escaped column name with backticks

### Issue 5: Empty Quiz
**Problem:** Daily challenge pointed to quiz with no questions
**Fix:** Updated to use Quiz 8 with 5 questions

### Issue 6: Endpoint Mismatch
**Problem:** Frontend called `/attempt` but backend had `/submit`
**Fix:** Changed backend route to `/attempt`

### Issue 7: Missing getStreak Method
**Problem:** Frontend called `getStreak()` but method didn't exist
**Fix:** Added method to LearningAPIService

## What's Still TODO

### 1. Admin Panel (Not Started)
**File to Create:** `RadaAppClean/src/screens/admin/DailyChallengesManagementScreen.tsx`

**Features Needed:**
- Calendar view to schedule challenges
- Quiz selector for each date
- XP reward configuration
- Preview today's challenge
- Analytics dashboard:
  - Participation rate
  - Average score
  - Completion time
  - Popular question types

### 2. Admin Backend Routes (Not Started)
**File to Update:** `learning-admin-api-routes.js`

**Routes Needed:**
- `POST /api/admin/learning/daily-challenges` - Create/schedule daily challenge
- `PUT /api/admin/learning/daily-challenges/:id` - Update challenge
- `DELETE /api/admin/learning/daily-challenges/:id` - Remove challenge
- `GET /api/admin/learning/daily-challenges/analytics` - Get participation stats

### 3. Notifications (Future Enhancement)
- Push notifications for daily challenges

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Table Name:** Used `user_daily_challenge_attempts` for clarity
2. **Computed Column:** Used `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` for percentage calculation
3. **Rank Variable:** Used `@user_rank` with backticks to avoid MySQL 8.0+ reserved word
4. **Streak Logic:** Requires 67%+ accuracy to maintain streak
5. **JSON Storage:** Store answers array as JSON for flexibility
6. **Unique Constraint:** Prevent multiple attempts per user per challenge
7. **Auto-Create:** Backend auto-creates daily challenge if none exists for today

---
