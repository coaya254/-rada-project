DELETE FROM career_history;
DELETE FROM education;
DELETE FROM politicians;

-- Clear learning data
DELETE FROM learning_quiz_questions;
DELETE FROM learning_quizzes;
DELETE FROM learning_lessons;
DELETE FROM learning_modules;
DELETE FROM learning_paths;

-- Clear news (keep external sources)
DELETE FROM news WHERE source_type = 'internal';

-- Reset auto-increment
ALTER TABLE politicians AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;
ALTER TABLE learning_modules AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;
```

#### **Import Real Data via SQL**

```sql
-- Example: Add real politician
INSERT INTO politicians (
